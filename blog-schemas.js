Start with a baseline 20-30% allocation to GEO to build competency and track early signals. If you discover your customers are already using AI for research, consider shifting to a higher percentage for GEO. The risk isn't over-investing in GEO, but being caught flat-footed when customer behavior shifts."

Tools like Semrush's AI Visibility Tracker and custom monitoring setups can measure these. Early data shows AI-referred traffic converts at 6x the rate of traditional search traffic."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "GEO actually favors small teams who can move quickly. Unlike SEO where domain authority takes years to build, GEO rewards freshness and authentic participation. A founder spending 30 minutes daily in relevant Reddit discussions can achieve more visibility than a competitor's $50K SEO campaign. Focus on one platform where your buyers congregate, contribute genuinely helpful content, and maintain a weekly content refresh cycle."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "First, most aren't. Our audits show only 14% of B2B companies appear consistently in AI recommendations. Second, GEO rewards specificity over scale. Instead of trying to compete everywhere, pick a narrow use case or workflow and dominate the conversation there. Find your beachhead and expand from there."

Basic tactics can improve your AI visibility by 30-50% and include basic schema markup, detailed FAQ sections, and structured content updates. These require solid web skills and attention to detail. Advanced tactics can push visibility increases to 100%+ but require advanced technical expertise."

Companies fail when they try to hack their way in with automated posts or thin content. Success comes from understanding that AI models are trained on human conversations. Be useful in those conversations, and the models learn to recommend you."
